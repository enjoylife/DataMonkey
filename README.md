DataMonkey
==========

Gambit of data structures and algorithms

----------

### Potential list of data structures to implement
* Skip list
* Linked list
* skip Graph
* resizable array

## Why create?
1. So that I can understand basic concepts of algorithm design. Reading in a book or paper only goes so 
far in the knowledge can be attained. Plus I learn better with a more "hands on" approach.
2. Gradually build up to newer and more cutting edge algorithms. Test for basic routines first, create the initial api
that is clean and effecient, add thread support etc.  

### Project Guidelines
* Quality comments along with tips for my forgetful self
  * "If I have to think longer than 10 seconds, comment it."
* Test for edges cases from multiple directions.
